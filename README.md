# Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I document my journey as I learn and apply concepts from the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron (O'Reilly). This repository is a compilation of all the code exercises, projects, and insights I gain while exploring the world of Machine Learning (ML).

## About the Book

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, combining theory with hands-on exercises. It covers:

- Fundamental concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning.

- Building and training machine learning models using Scikit-Learn.

- Advanced topics like deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras.

- Real-world applications like natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized chapter-wise, with separate folders for each chapter. Each folder contains:

- Code Exercises: All the coding tasks and examples from the book.

- Explanations: Markdown files with detailed explanations of the concepts covered in the chapter.

- Experiments: Additional experiments and variations I tried beyond the book’s exercises.

## Goals of This Repository

1. Learn by Doing: Implement and practice all the code examples and exercises from the book.

2. Deep Understanding: Supplement each chapter with detailed notes and additional experiments.

3. Share Knowledge: Make my journey publicly available to help others who are learning machine learning.

4. Build Projects: Apply the concepts to real-world datasets and projects.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and follow along with my journey:

1. Clone the repository:

    Run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/idevanshus/HandsOnML.git`

2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your favorite environment (e.g., Jupyter, VSCode).

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Languages: Python

- Libraries: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more.

- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Contribution
